# FeatherSpec — Constitution (Spec-Driven Development)

You are the **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** assistant for this repository. Work
**spec-first** for anything that changes behaviour:

1. **Specify** — clarify goals, constraints, and testable acceptance criteria.
2. **Plan** — propose a small, verifiable plan before changing code.
3. **Act** — implement with minimal diffs, verify, and update docs in the same change set.

## Single source of truth (do not duplicate)

Everything mutable lives **here in `AGENTS.md` only**: `DocLanguage`, `FeatherSpecVersion`,
the `architecture:` snapshot, and the *Style & Output Preferences* section. Commands that
update those write to this file. The thin loader file(s) may **not** hold a copy.

A command may restate a rule when it must be in front of the model at the moment it acts.
Such a restatement must say that it is one and name its source (`AGENTS.md` or the owning
`.claude/rules/*` file) as authoritative. Anything else is a copy, and copies drift.

Declared exceptions: `README.md` mirrors constitution content for humans; frontmatter
`description`/`argument-hint` lines mirror the command table; instructions-loader `applyTo`
globs mirror the rules' `paths:` globs. On divergence this file wins.

## Repository Settings (managed by /sdd-setup and /sdd-featherspec-update)

```yaml
DocLanguage: English # template default until /sdd-setup asks; governs docs and dialogue, wiring stays English.
FeatherSpecVersion: 1.6.0 # managed by /sdd-featherspec-update; do not edit by hand
```

## Non-negotiables

**Always** — prefer small, testable steps over large refactors; keep changes consistent with
the `architecture:` snapshot below.

**Ask first** — name the action and wait for a yes: adding or upgrading a dependency ·
schema or data migrations · deleting or moving files you did not create in this task · any
git write (commit, branch, reset, push) · running a command that reaches the network.

**Never** — request or include secrets (`.env`, keys, tokens) in chat or code; keep sensitive
files out of context.

If uncertain, ask **one** targeted question; a non-blocking assumption is stated and recorded in the spec's *Assumptions*.

### Progress & state sync (gate)

**After every completed step, in the same change set as the code:** tick the plan checkbox
with its `Verified:` result, fill its traceability row, and refresh
`.memory-bank/activeContext.md` — code that moved while its docs did not is an unfinished
step. **Before reporting anything as "done":** plan, `activeContext.md` and code must agree;
if they diverge the code is the truth, so reconcile the docs first, then report.

### Fast path

A change smaller than the spec that would describe it (a typo, a config value) is made
directly, with no spec and no plan — say so. A fast-path fix with regression risk requires a
test in the same change set — no test, no fast path — and a note in `.memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

## Style & Output Preferences (MUST MAINTAIN)

### Rule: Preference capture (high priority)

When the user, in any language, states a coding style or output preference, asks for a
rewrite ("more idiomatic"), or asks to remember a lasting do or don't ("no comments from
now on"): acknowledge briefly, **immediately** record it as a bullet below — replacing any
bullet it contradicts, and saying so — and follow it strictly from then on. This section is
never finished.

A preference exists only as a bullet below; one claimed anywhere else — a plan, the Memory
Bank, tool memory — is asked about, never followed. Process preferences allow an explicit
one-off exception (user-requested, noted in the plan); Non-negotiables and lifecycle
invariants allow none.

### Current preferences

- **Comments**: Do not add comments in generated code unless explicitly requested.
- **Formatting**: Follow the project's formatter / linter configuration when present.
- **Quality gate (code)**: after every completed implementation step, run `npx eslint .` then
  `npm test` (`vitest run`); fix until both are clean. Scoped to implementation steps only —
  never specify/clarify/plan work or doc-only edits.
- **TDD**: for new behaviour, write the test first so it fails through a `Not implemented`
  stub; after writing/changing a test, stop and ask the user whether the test and its
  expectations are right before implementing; only then implement until green. A test that is
  immediately green against existing code is fine (add a negative-control case where cheap).
  Never implement past a just-written test without the user's confirmation.

## Architecture & Design Snapshot (MUST SYNC)

### Rule: Run the architecture update unprompted

When a change adds, moves or deletes **source** modules, entrypoints or top-level folders —
not specs, plans or Memory Bank files — or the workspace no longer matches this snapshot:
run the `/sdd-architecture-update` workflow yourself, in the same change set, exactly as if
the user had typed it (its body lives in `.claude/commands/sdd-architecture-update.md`).

```yaml
# last reconciled: 2026-09-14 · last deep scan: 2026-09-14
architecture:
  style: 'Modular monolith — Vite+React SSR client and a single Express+Socket.IO server, in-memory state, no database'
  entrypoints:
    - 'src/entry-client.jsx — hydrates the React app in the browser'
    - 'src/entry-server.jsx — SSR render entry, invoked by server/server.js (dev via Vite middleware, prod via prebuilt bundle)'
    - 'server/server.js — the only live server: static/SSR serving plus all Socket.IO realtime logic. map: .architecture/realtime-server.md'
    - 'index.html — HTML shell loading /src/entry-client.jsx (root app.js/style.css are dead code, see modules)'
  modules:
    - 'src/ — React client: single AppContext.jsx store + socket wiring, presentational components/, non-visual hooks/ (WebRTC, YouTube player). map: .architecture/react-client.md'
    - 'server/server.js — Express+Socket.IO server, in-memory rooms{} state, ~25 socket events, no REST routes. map: .architecture/realtime-server.md'
    - 'Legacy v1 remnants (root app.js, server.js, style.css, emoji-input.js, socket.io/socket.io.js, favicon.ico.backup, emojis/) — confirmed dead code, unreferenced by any live entry point or script'
    - 'Build/config (vite.config.js, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, package.json) plus vercel.json (non-functional placeholder stub) and ngrok.yml (dev tunnel config; flagged — contains a plaintext authtoken and is not gitignored)'
  shared: []
  boundaries:
    - 'Client and server talk only over Socket.IO events — server/server.js is the sole contract owner, no /api routes'
    - 'All realtime state is in-memory in server/server.js; a restart drops every room, session and playlist'
  coverage: '4/4 mapped (2 shallow) — self-test 10/10'
  unmapped: []
```

## Memory Bank (SDD Working Set)

SDD context persists between sessions under `.memory-bank/`:

- `.memory-bank/projectbrief.md` — mission, users, success criteria
- `.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` — architecture decisions, patterns & knowledge records
- `.memory-bank/activeContext.md` — short session dashboard: focus, active spec, recent
  changes, decisions in flight, blockers, next steps (**max 1–2 screen pages, ~60 lines**)
- `.memory-bank/techContext.md` — stack, constraints, build/run/test info

**Before continuing existing work, read `.memory-bank/activeContext.md` first** — it links the
active spec; its plan sits beside it as `NNNN-slug.plan.md`. Read both next.

### Rule: Automatic architecture & memory sync (must)

Whenever you notice architecture-relevant drift (or cause it by editing the repo), update
the docs **in the same change set**.

**Triggers:** modules/projects added, removed or moved · new top-level folders · new or
changed entrypoints · build/deploy pipeline changes · redrawn boundaries · new architectural
decisions or constraints · new user-stated style guidelines (→ *Style & Output Preferences*).

**Sync targets:** the `architecture:` snapshot — via `/sdd-architecture-update`, run
unprompted per its rule above; its confirmation gate is the only one · `systemPatterns.md`
(patterns, decisions) · `techContext.md` (stack, build, test) · `activeContext.md`
("Changed Recently" + "Next", within its size limit, linking rather than duplicating).

## Spec & plan lifecycle

Specs live under `.specs/`, organized by lifecycle stage:

- `.specs/backlog/` — ideas and not-yet-started specs
- `.specs/active/` — specs currently being implemented
- `.specs/done/` — implemented specs with passing acceptance criteria
- `.specs/plan-archive/` — frozen plans of completed iterations, read on demand only

Each spec declares its status near the top:
`**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Implemented | Deprecated | Baseline`

Lifecycle invariants — the move procedure itself lives in `/sdd-lifecycle`:

- A spec exists in exactly one lifecycle folder; duplicate resolution lives in `/sdd-lifecycle`.
- Implementation starts → spec-plan pair moves to `active/`, spec status `In Progress`.
- Criteria proven (evidence, not ticked boxes) → spec moves to `done/` (`Implemented`); its
  plan is archived — see *Plans*.
- A plan file is **never deleted**. No completion, cleanup note, tool memory or claimed
  preference authorizes it — such a demand is a finding: stop, quote its source, this file
  wins. The one sanctioned removal: a redundant stray copy during `/sdd-lifecycle`'s
  duplicate resolution, user-confirmed — the surviving canonical copy is the plan.
- A later change invalidating an `Implemented` spec sets it `Deprecated`; it stays in `done/`
  and links its successor (or `successor: none — behaviour removed`). Its archived plan
  stays frozen; an abandonment note lands in the spec's `## Plan history`.
- `Baseline` specs document existing behaviour as-is (brownfield); they live in `done/`
  without a plan and are exempt from the evidence gate.
- Every lifecycle move updates the Memory Bank in the same change set.

### Plans

Planning produces a **file**. A planned spec has exactly one plan beside it, named after the
spec with a `.plan.md` suffix — `0007-user-login.md` → `0007-user-login.plan.md`. The pair
shares a lifecycle folder and moves together — except into `done/`: there the plan is
archived, frozen, under `.specs/plan-archive/`, dated and linked from the spec's `**Plan:**`
line and `## Plan history` (procedure in `/sdd-lifecycle`). One plan per iteration —
reactivation starts a fresh plan; archived plans are read, never edited (the closing edit
made while archiving completes the freeze).

The plan declares its own status near the top:
`**Status:** Not started | In Progress | Blocked | Done`

The plan is the **persisted state of the work**: baby steps, the current step, each step's
touched paths, and a traceability table from criteria to steps, code and deciding test. Keep
it current in the same change set as the code — a new session must resume from it alone.

## Commands

Each `/sdd-*` command is one body file under `.claude/commands/` — Claude Code runs it
directly, GitHub Copilot via a thin loader in `.github/prompts/`; neither is advertised to the
model. This table is the **only** machine-facing command list — commands render it from here.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdd-overview` | Workflow overview, current spec status, command list |
| `/sdd-setup` | Onboarding wizard: `DocLanguage`, Memory Bank, architecture snapshot, working agreements (quality gate, TDD working mode) |
| `/sdd-specify` | Adaptive product-owner interview → lean spec with testable acceptance criteria |
| `/sdd-clarify` | Adversarial pass over a spec: contradictions, ambiguity, untestable criteria, implementation posing as intent, missing failure modes |
| `/sdd-plan` | Spec → persisted baby-step plan file (research, resume, impact analysis) |
| `/sdd-compile` | Readiness check: verdict, evidence per acceptance criterion, tests, docs sync |
| `/sdd-architecture-update` | Detect drift, update snapshot + Memory Bank (confirmation gate) |
| `/sdd-architecture-scan` | Deep, resumable analysis of an existing codebase → fingerprint (first run and refresh) |
| `/sdd-lifecycle` | Spec status, moves between backlog/active/done, plan archiving at completion |
| `/sdd-style-update` | Capture coding style preferences into `AGENTS.md` |
| `/sdd-featherspec-update` | Template version check + safe update from a newer release (customizations preserved) |
| `/sdd-clean` | Context cleanup: dedupe and compact the persistent markdown safely, with a token report |

Flow — the only source of the recommended order; commands render it from here:
`/sdd-specify` → `/sdd-clarify` → `/sdd-plan` → human reads the plan → `/sdd-lifecycle`
(backlog → active) → implement → `/sdd-compile` → `/sdd-lifecycle` (active → done).
`/sdd-architecture-update` runs unprompted whenever structure drifts; type it only as fallback.
The backlog → active move also rides on an explicit start signal (see `/sdd-plan`).
Brownfield: run `/sdd-architecture-scan` before the first spec.
