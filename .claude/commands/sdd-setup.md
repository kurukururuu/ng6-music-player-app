# /sdd-setup — SDD Setup Wizard

The user may name a documentation language, project name, or stack after the command. If any
are missing, ask for them in the wizard below.

You are running an onboarding wizard for this repository.

## Session opening — language first, then orientation

Open under a `🪶 **FeatherSpec**` banner with at most two short **English** sentences — a
warm one-line welcome to the template and that setup starts with one question — then
immediately ask **Step 0** (the language question). Everything before the language is
chosen stays English and minimal: no SDD explanation, no command table yet.
A mixed-language opening is exactly what this ordering prevents. **A re-run is a repository a
previous setup already touched** — the Memory Bank carries real content instead of `TBD`
placeholders, or the snapshot has been reconciled at least once — or a run where the language
arrived as an argument. Only then open in that language, confirm it in one line instead of
re-asking Step 0, and compress the orientation to one sentence: a re-run tunes, it does not
re-onboard. The `DocLanguage:` value the template ships with is a default nobody chose, so it
never makes a run a re-run: a first setup asks Step 0 even though `AGENTS.md` carries a value.

**After** `DocLanguage` is set, give the whole orientation in `DocLanguage`:

- Explain Spec-Driven Development in 3–5 plain sentences, rendering this definition
  faithfully in `DocLanguage` (translate it — do not quote English into a non-English
  session): *Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is an AI-assisted development approach where a
  clear, structured, versioned specification is the primary artifact. Implementation and
  tests are derived from the spec and continuously validated against it (generate →
  verify → refine). Because agents generate code anchored to an explicit spec — and their
  output can be checked, corrected and regenerated against it — SDD yields higher-quality,
  more maintainable code than unstructured "vibe" prompting. The spec survives the
  implementation and stays the reference point for change.*
- State this repo's operating protocol as `AGENTS.md` defines it at the top — the
  three-step form is load-bearing, so render the three steps in `DocLanguage` without
  adding or merging steps.
- Show the `/sdd-*` commands from the **Commands** table in `AGENTS.md` — all of them, in
  `DocLanguage`. That table is the single machine-facing roster; keep no second copy here.
  Name the usual order in one line, rendered from the Flow line under *Commands*.

Keep the orientation short, then continue the wizard with Step 1.

## How to ask (every wizard question)

- Where the environment offers a structured question/input UI, use it; otherwise plain
  markdown — **never a code fence** around a question, fences kill wrapping and rendering.
- Prefer proposing over asking. Everything the repo, manifests or stack already answer is
  bundled into **one** "here is what I derived — correct anything" confirmation; only the
  genuinely open steps are asked, one per message — never a wall of eight questions.
- Name the source of every pre-fill — "from `package.json`", "template default in
  `AGENTS.md`", "from my saved user memory (which you asked me to keep earlier)" — never
  vague claims like "from your notes" or "your saved preferences": template defaults are
  not the user's notes, and an unnamed source in a fresh project reads as spooky, not smart.

## Step 0 (MUST be the first question)

Ask exactly: **"In which language should the project documentation Markdown files be written?"**
Ask it on every first setup. `AGENTS.md` always carries a `DocLanguage` value — that is the
template's default, not the user's answer, and skipping the question because a value is present
is the one way this step can silently fail.

- If the user does not answer, infer it from the conversation language.
- After a language is chosen, set `DocLanguage` in `AGENTS.md` (the **only** place it lives).
- Then write all project docs (Memory Bank + specs) in that language, rewriting the default
  English templates if needed.
- From here on, conduct the entire dialogue — every question, confirmation and summary —
  in `DocLanguage`. Only this template's own files stay English.

## Step 1 (MUST follow Step 0): Project mode

Run `git ls-files` and count source files outside this template's own folders
(`.claude/`, `.github/`, `.specs/`, `.memory-bank/`, `.vscode/`). Guess the mode —
substantial source files plus a snapshot still at `TBD` or `# last reconciled: never`
suggests existing software — state your guess, then ask exactly this question,
rendered in `DocLanguage`:
**"Is this a new project, or existing software we are adopting?"**

- **New project** → continue with this wizard unchanged.
- **Existing software** → present the choice as a short plain-language briefing in
  `DocLanguage` (~5 lines), and **recommend the deep architecture scan**: it builds
  the architecture fingerprint from the code, and with it agents jump straight to the
  right files instead of searching — cheaper and faster in every later session, higher
  quality, fewer wrong assumptions, and technical planning starts from a shared map.
  Say honestly that the scan reads code and, depending on project size, takes time and
  noticeable tokens. Name the alternatives: describe the architecture yourself, or
  seed only the Memory Bank now and scan later. If the scan is chosen: first collect
  wizard steps 1, 2, 7 and 8 (only the human knows mission, audience, working mode and
  taste), then run the `/sdd-architecture-scan` workflow yourself, exactly as if the user
  had typed it (its body lives in `.claude/commands/sdd-architecture-scan.md`). Skip wizard
  steps 3–5 — the scan answers them from the code and writes `techContext.md` and
  `systemPatterns.md` itself; step 6 shrinks to one confirmation question over the gates
  the scan found. Afterwards finish only actions B (projectbrief + activeContext, plus the
  *Quality gates* section in `techContext.md` from the step-6 confirmation), D, E and F.

## Read the repo before asking

Manifests and lock files (stack, package manager) · the tree's top two levels (entrypoints,
modules) · CI config and test scripts (quality gates) · any README · the existing
`.memory-bank/*` files and the current `AGENTS.md` (snapshot, style preferences). Never ask
for what you can read: pre-fill steps 3, 5 and 6 below from what you found and present them
for correction in one turn. On a re-run, merge with what exists — never reset a curated file.

## Wizard steps (ask only what the repo did not answer)

Every question carries one short clause of why it is asked (what it seeds) — plain
language, no lecture.

1. **Project name & one-liner**
2. **Primary users / target audience**
3. **Tech stack** (languages, frameworks, runtime, package managers) — pre-fill from manifests
4. **Architecture style** (modular monolith / microservices / layered / hexagonal / other) —
   this one needs interpretation, so ask even when you have a guess, and say what you guessed
5. **Repo entrypoints** (apps, services, CLIs, APIs) — pre-fill from the tree
6. **Quality gate** — written for someone who has never heard the term. Explain first, in
   one or two plain sentences, what it is for: to keep AI-implemented code trustworthy, the
   matching linter and the unit tests run after every completed implementation step, and
   the code is fixed until both come back with zero warnings and zero errors. Then propose
   the concrete commands from the detected stack and ask whether that is what should run —
   exact commands with flags, e.g. JS/TS: `npx eslint .` → `npx tsc --noEmit` → `npm test`;
   .NET: `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` → `dotnet build -warnaserror` → `dotnet test`;
   Python: `ruff check` → `mypy` → `pytest`. Jargon ("Definition of Green") may be named as
   the term of art, never used as the question.
7. **TDD working mode** — explain in plain language (many users have never worked
   test-first), present the **default**, and ask only whether it fits or should differ —
   never a multiple-choice quiz. The default: *for new behaviour the test comes first and
   fails through a `Not implemented` stub, so it fails for the right reason; after writing
   or changing a test, stop and ask the user whether the test and its expectations are
   right; only after that go, implement until green. A new test that is green immediately
   because existing code already covers it is fine — where it is cheap, add a negative
   control case proving the test can fail. Never implement past a just-written test
   without the user's confirmation.* The user changes it by simply saying so.
8. **Coding preferences** (comments, naming, patterns to avoid)

Steps 6 and 7 are never answered by assumption: if the user skips them, ask each again,
individually, before writing anything.

## Actions you must perform

After collecting answers:

**A) Ensure folders** (already present in this template; create only if missing):
`.memory-bank/`, `.specs/backlog/`, `.specs/active/`, `.specs/done/`, `.specs/plan-archive/`.

**B) Initialize documentation** in `DocLanguage`:

- Update `.memory-bank/projectbrief.md` with mission + primary users + success criteria.
- Update `.memory-bank/techContext.md` with stack + build/run/test, plus a *Quality gates*
  section listing the confirmed Definition-of-Green commands in order — `/sdd-plan` reads
  them from here, and `/sdd-compile` re-runs them via the plan's *Quality gates* line.
- Create `.memory-bank/activeContext.md` only if missing or still placeholder (`TBD`) —
  otherwise leave it, it may hold live session state. **Read `.claude/rules/memory-bank.md`
  first** and follow its *Structure* section exactly — that section is the only definition of
  this file's shape, and a brand-new file does not load the rule on its own.
- Create/update `.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with initial patterns/decisions.

**C) Initial architecture capture (best-effort):**

- Inspect the current workspace structure.
- Populate the `architecture:` snapshot in `AGENTS.md` from the folder/project layout.
- If assumptions are required, write them down and ask the user to confirm (one question).

**D) Style & working preference capture:**

- Seed *Style & Output Preferences* in `AGENTS.md` with what the user stated — in English
  (`AGENTS.md` is wiring), one bullet per preference. Two bullets come from the wizard:
  **Quality gate (code)** — run the Definition-of-Green commands from `techContext.md` after
  every completed implementation step and loop until zero warnings and errors, **scoped
  explicitly: it binds implementation steps only, never specify/clarify/plan work or
  doc-only edits** — and **TDD** with the working mode confirmed in step 7 (default:
  red-first via `Not implemented` stubs for new behaviour; stop after every new or changed
  test for the user's confirmation before implementing; immediately-green tests against
  existing code allowed, with a negative control where it is cheap).

**E) Budget check:**

- Measure `AGENTS.md` against the cap in `.claude/rules/constitution.md`; if clearly over,
  beyond its tolerance clause, propose one eviction per its order before finishing.

**F) Baseline commit (Ask-first):**

- If the repository has no commit yet, propose one now (e.g. `chore: adopt FeatherSpec and
  seed project docs`). A first commit anchors plan baselines, scope checks and safe
  lifecycle moves (`git mv`); without it every later safety net runs blind. The git write
  stays behind the Ask-first gate in `AGENTS.md`.

## Output

- Summarize what you created/updated and what you inferred.
- Suggest 1–3 next commands: `/sdd-specify`, `/sdd-plan`, `/sdd-architecture-update`, `/sdd-lifecycle`.
