# /sdd-architecture-update — Architecture Reconciliation

The user may name a focus area (module, folder, or concern) after the command; it is optional.

## Gather context first

Read the current `architecture:` snapshot from `AGENTS.md`. Inspect the tree's top two levels
for new structures, and verify every path the snapshot names (entrypoints, modules, shared) at
whatever depth it sits — boundary changes hide below level two.

## Goal

Compare the actual repository structure with the `architecture:` snapshot in `AGENTS.md` and
reconcile them.

## Steps

1. Read the tree and the current snapshot.
2. Identify changes that matter architecturally: new/moved/removed top-level folders; new
   entrypoints, apps, services, packages, modules; changed boundaries or shared components.
   Where `.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` holds `fs-knowledge:` blocks, read
   `.claude/rules/knowledge-records.md` now and treat those records as reconciliation targets
   too: a moved or renamed path that a record's evidence names is drift like any other.
3. Present a **delta report**: what changed (observed), why it matters (brief), and the
   proposed updates to the snapshot and Memory Bank docs.

## When reconciliation is not enough

If the tree shows several structures the snapshot cannot place, the snapshot names paths that
no longer exist, or the focus area sits under `unmapped:` — do not guess. Recommend
`/sdd-architecture-scan` (with the focus path) in the delta report instead. (This escalation
rule is owned here; `AGENTS.md` only mandates running this workflow unprompted.)

## Confirmation gate

Before writing anything, ask:

- "Is this the change you expected?"
- "Anything else I should include (e.g., context not visible in the code)?"

Only after confirmation:

- Update the `architecture:` YAML in `AGENTS.md` (the only place it lives), and set the
  `# last reconciled:` comment inside that block to today's date — a snapshot with no date
  cannot be told apart from one that was never checked. Snapshot **values** are written in
  `DocLanguage`, one YAML list item per entry.
- When `.architecture/` exists, update the affected module map(s) and their
  `# last reconciled:` lines in the same change set.
- Update `.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (patterns, decisions and knowledge records). Retarget
  every evidence path and id reference the change moved, in this same change set. Report as
  findings — never fix silently — an id no record answers, a duplicate id, a provenance source
  that no longer exists, and a record whose evidence paths have all disappeared. That last one is
  the only case where you *propose* retiring a record: name it in the delta report and leave a
  one-line retired-id comment only after the user confirms. Never delete a record and never turn
  `decided` into `unknown` on your own — only the user retracts a confirmed reason.
- Update `.memory-bank/techContext.md` when stack, build or test facts changed.
- Update `.memory-bank/activeContext.md` (recent changes + next steps; size limit from
  `AGENTS.md`).
- Measure `AGENTS.md` against the cap in `.claude/rules/constitution.md`; if over, propose an
  eviction per its order.
- When the Memory Bank files have visibly outgrown their purpose during this sync, recommend
  `/sdd-clean` in the delta report — never clean up here as a side effect.

## When invoked from /sdd-architecture-scan

Treat the scan's distilled findings as the observed state — knowledge records included; include
its coverage figures and navigation self-test score in the delta report; on confirmation also set `last deep scan` in
the snapshot comment. The gate above stays the snapshot's only write gate. If the findings
arrive without a recorded self-test score, do not open the gate — send the scan back to run
its self-test first: an unverified fingerprint is not observed state. On confirmation the
distilled findings replace the snapshot's **values**, not just its structure: wording,
`DocLanguage` and the per-line purpose clauses count as drift, so "the paths are the same"
is never a reason to keep weaker values. Persist the self-test score in the snapshot's
`coverage:` line, and write nothing outside this gate's sync list — the constitution's own
wiring prose is not a reconciliation target.

When the scan hands over persisted `unknown` rationales, it makes exactly one offer inside this
gate dialogue — after the two questions above are answered and before anything is written. That
offer is the only sanctioned sibling of this gate; its wording and its bounded round live in
`.claude/commands/sdd-architecture-scan.md`. Declining writes the `deferred:` markers in this
same confirmed merge.

Everything must remain **DocLanguage-aware**.
